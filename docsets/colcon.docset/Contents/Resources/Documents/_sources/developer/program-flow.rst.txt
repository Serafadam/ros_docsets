Program flow
============

The following depicts the high level program flow of a couple of verbs.

list
----

This verb is provided by the ``colcon-package-information`` package.

.. digraph:: list

   initial [shape="point", width="0.2"];
   initial -> get_package_descriptors [label=" args"];
   get_package_descriptors -> topological_order_packages [label=" set(pkg descriptor)"];
   topological_order_packages -> select_package_decorators [label=" list(pkg decorator)"];
   select_package_decorators -> decision [label=" list(pkg decorator)"];
   decision [label="", shape="diamond"];

   merge [label="", shape="diamond"];
   decision:sw -> merge:nw [xlabel=" alphabetical order "];
   decision:se -> merge:ne [label=" topological order"];

   merge -> print [label=" list(pkg decorator)"];
   print [label="print pkg name / path / type"];
   print -> activity_final;
   activity_final [label="", shape="circle", width="0.2"];
